# Bulk Uploader of Shopify Product Metafields

This app allows one to assign metafields to an arbitrar.ily large array of products in a store's inventory by importing an Excel sheet with product IDs and the desired product metafields. This tool replaces the only other alternative: manually going into potentially hundreds of product settings pages and setting/configuring metafields manually.
