# Bulk Uploader of Shopify Product Attributes

This app allows one to assign attributes to an arbitrarily large array of products in a store's inventory by importing an Excel sheet with product IDs and the desired product attributes. This tool replaces the only other alternative: manually going into potentially hundreds of product settings pages and setting/configuring attributes manually.
