# Custom Shopify App

This app allows one to tag an arbitrarily large array of products in a store's inventory by importing an Excel sheet with product IDs and the desired product tags. This tool replaces the only other alternative: manually going into potentially hundreds of product settings pages and setting/configuring tags manually.
